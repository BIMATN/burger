### Burger
---
* This assignment was given to me during my coding bootcamp experience
* I was tasked with creating a website that allows people to create a burger, and then eat that very burger
* The site incorporates an MVC design and utilizes MYSQL, NODE, EXPRESS, HTML, BOOTSTRAP, and Javascript
* The site is also deployed on Heroku
* We had one week to complete this assignment and the purpose was to focus on the backend more than the frontend
